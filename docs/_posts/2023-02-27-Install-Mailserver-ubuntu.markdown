Notes:

This is a lengthy tutorial, involving several installation commands and configurations. Make sure that you execute all the commands and apply all the configurations since it's really difficult to debug on missing even a single configuration. Now take a deep breath, calm down, have a cup of tea/coffee or beer mug, put light music, relax, and follow the instructions in the subsequent sections of this tutorial. Also, do not rush while installing your email server and make sure that you have sufficient time to debug if something goes wrong.
This tutorial used example.com domain for demonstration purposes. Also, it used mail.example.com as the server hostname. Make sure to replace example.com and mail.example.com with your actual domain and server hostname.
This tutorial tries to cover all the major aspects to set up a production email server. You can further refine and update the configurations based on your requirements.
I have tried to keep this guide short without explaining the configurations and parameters.
You will have a complete email server ready for production usage by following this tutorial. You may further enhance it based on your actual requirements.
Also, add notes by submitting your valuable comments in case you have some suggestions or better configuration options.
